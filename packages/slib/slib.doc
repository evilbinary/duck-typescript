SYNOPSIS
       slib  [ scheme | scm | gsi | gosh | guile | scheme48 | larceny | scmlit

DESCRIPTION
       "SLIB" is a portable library for the programming language "Scheme".  It
       provides  a  platform  independent  framework  for  using "packages" of
       Scheme procedures and syntax.  As distributed, SLIB contains many  use‚Äê
       ful  packages.  Its catalog can be transparently extended to accomodate
       packages specific to a site, implementation, user, or directory.

OPTIONS
       The optional argument to the slib script is the  Scheme  implementation
       to  run.   Absent  the argument, it searches for implementations in the
       above order.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH
              is the SLIB Scheme library directory (with a trailing "/").

FILES
       slib.info
              Texinfo documentation of slib.

AUTHORS
       Aubrey Jaffer (agj @ alum.mit.edu) and scores of others.

       The full documentation for slib is maintained as a Texinfo  manual.  If
       the  info  and  slib  programs are properly installed at your site, the
       command
              info slib

       should give you access to the complete manual.
