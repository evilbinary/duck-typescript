;"Pink" and "brown" are used instead of the more logical "pale red" and
;"dark orange".
;
;http://www.anthus.com/Colors/Cent.html by David A. Mundie, converted
;the NBS Centroid colors from Munsell to CIE XYZ, then converted to Mac
;QuickDraw RGB.  The colors were visibly biased towards pink and had
;duplications.
;
;John Foster reconverted supplied Munsell values via Munsell software
;downloaded from www.gretagmacbeth.com <http://www.gretagmacbeth.com>
;directly to RGB, and tried to resolve some duplicates.  Some of these
;don't even look right, because some of the bright colors are on the
;dark fringes with less chroma and are not centered and high up on the
;hue curves.  Many of the original Munsell values (noted) are outside
;the RGB gamut, and have been adjusted to the closest brightest RGB
;value by changing chroma until 0 or 255 is reached in one out of
;bounds RGB component.  Guesses were made in a few cases (noted) where
;the color was still illogical compared to the name.
