slib-3b5 news:

SLIB's new multidimensional space-filling package has algorithms which
unify the encoding and decoding of Hilbert and Peano curves of any
rank, their inverses, and novel variations.  Read the paper at
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1807>

Otherwise, slib-3b5 is a minor release.  Details at
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/slib/slib/ChangeLog>

  * rmdsff.scm (make-cell, integer->coordinates)
  (coordinates->integer): Don't depend on LETREC* behavior.

  * Makefile, mklibcat.scm, rmdsff.scm, slib.texi (space-filling):
  Added "rmdsff.scm" and documentation.

  * phil-spc.scm, schmooz.scm, slib.texi: Because TeXinfo-5 changed
  the rules, don't allow text between @defun and @defunx.

  * usercat: Use local copy of "schmooz.scm".
