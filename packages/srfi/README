Scheme Requests for Implementation (SRFIs), as R6RS libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------

The libraries' names conform to SRFI 97: SRFI Libraries.  There is a registry of
available SRFIs and other platform features which works alongside SRFI 0:
Feature-Based Conditional Expansion.  The porting done so far is mostly just
taking the reference implementations from http://srfi.schemers.org and wrapping
them in libraries and tweaking the few things needed to make them work in R6RS
libraries and with implementations' functionality.  Supporting any R6RS
implementation supporting the *.IMPL.sls convention is easy.

These SRFIs are available:
  (srfi :0 cond-expand)
  (srfi :1 lists)
  (srfi :2 and-let*)
  (srfi :6 basic-string-ports)
  (srfi :8 receive)
  (srfi :9 records)
  (srfi :11 let-values)
  (srfi :13 strings)
  (srfi :14 char-sets)
  (srfi :16 case-lambda)
  (srfi :19 time)
  (srfi :23 error)
  (srfi :25 multi-dimensional-arrays)
  (srfi :26 cut)
  (srfi :27 random-bits)
  (srfi :31 rec)
  (srfi :37 args-fold)
  (srfi :38 with-shared-structure)
  (srfi :39 parameters)
  (srfi :41 streams)
  (srfi :42 eager-comprehensions)
  (srfi :43 vectors)
  (srfi :45 lazy)
  (srfi :48 intermediate-format-strings)
  (srfi :61 cond)
  (srfi :64 testing)
  (srfi :67 compare-procedures)
  (srfi :69 basic-hash-tables)
  (srfi :78 lightweight-testing)
  (srfi :98 os-environment-variables)
  (srfi :99 records)

Other SRFIs are not available because there hasn't been a demand for them or
they're not possible as an R6RS library.  If you already have ported SRFIs to
R6RS, we'd love to assimilate them.  You can let us know by "asking a question"
at the Scheme Libraries project page:

  https://launchpad.net/scheme-libraries

Currently supported systems are Chez Scheme, Ikarus, Larceny, and Ypsilon.
PLT Scheme is only semi-supported because it has its own "srfi" directory
which conflicts with having another "srfi" directory; you can symlink/copy
files from this collection into PLT's "srfi" directory.
